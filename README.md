# AUV_simulator
Numerically solve the dynamics and control of a simplified AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) model.

A torphedo-shaped AUV is simulated to follow a sequence of target locations and to avoid an obstacle within a 150 m^2 box. The AUV is subjected to a uniform background marine current. The AUV has a single maneuvering surface, which provides a trajectory control via a virtual PID controller. The equations of motion are numerically integrated by a fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme. The MAIN.m script runs the simulation shown in the movie trajectory_test_AUV_2D.mp4.
The hydrodynamic and propulsion models are taken from the following research papers:
